  <h2>An Evening Full of Celebration ✨</h2>

  <p>
    Your reception is where the formalities fade and the celebrations begin.
    It’s the moment where you step into a room filled with smiles, music,
    laughter, and the warmth of your loved ones coming together to celebrate
    your journey.
  </p>


  <div className="exp-image">

  </div>

  <p>
    Unlike the rituals of the wedding day, the reception is all about
    expression — your style, your energy, and your vibe. From the way
    you make your grand entry to the music that fills the dance floor,
    every element reflects your personality.
  </p>

  <p>
    We focus on creating an atmosphere that feels alive — where guests
    are engaged, moments feel effortless, and the entire evening flows
    beautifully without interruptions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because at the end of the night, it’s not just about how it looked —
    it’s about how it felt. And we make sure it feels unforgettable.
